# Urban Paws Website

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new startup company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that are have been developed and products that are for sale via links to listings on Amazon.co.uk.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate, that allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news, that provides links to the company social media accounts and links to enable the customer to purchase products.

The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.
