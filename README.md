# Urban Paws Website

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new start-up company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that are currently being developed and that will be for sale in the near future. The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate and that allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news.

## User Experience Design

### Strategy - work out if should use these headers

The business goals for debveloping the website are:

- To attract users to the company website to promote the company and brand awareness and to drive online enquiries.
- To provide a simple, attractive, modern and responsive website.
- To present a consistent brand image to users.

### User Stories

#### Business

- As the business owner, I want the company branding template to be applied to the website, so that the company presents a consistent brand image.
- As the business owner, I want the website to be load quickly, so that users are not left waiting for the website to respond.

#### First time visitors

- As a first time visitor to the website, I want to be able to access the website on different devices, so that i can use the device that is most convenient to me at the time.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website, so that i can find out more about the company and it's offerings.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to follow the company on social media platforms, so that I can stay informed about the company.


#### Returning visitors

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the company, so that I can ask questions or receive announcements and updates about the company.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Scope

### Structure

### Skeleton

### Surface

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

### Branding


### Colours



### Typography



## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

Remeber to include JIRA, Trello etc.

## Testing

Focus testing on meeting the defined acceptance criteria documented alongside user stories.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
