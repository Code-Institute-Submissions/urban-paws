# Urban Paws Website

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new start-up company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that are currently being developed and that will be available for sale in the near future. The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate and that allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news.

## User Experience Design

### Strategy

The business goals for developing the website are:

-   To attract users to the company website to promote the company and brand awareness and to drive online enquiries.
-   To provide a simple, attractive, modern and responsive website.
-   To present a consistent brand image to users.

### Scope

#### User Stories

#### Business

-   As the branding director, I want the company branding template to be applied to the website so that the company presents a consistent brand image.
-   As the business owner, I want the company website latency to be optimised so that users are less likely to abandon our website whilst using it.
-   As the business owner, I want the company website to be search engine optimised, so that users can easily find our website.

#### First time visitors

-   As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to be able to access the website on different devices so that i can use the device that is most convenient to me at the time.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website so that I can find out more about the company and it's offerings.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to follow the company on social media platforms so that I can stay informed about the company.

#### Returning visitors

-   As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the company so that I can ask questions or receive announcements and updates about the company.
-   As a returning visitor, I want to see new products that have been added so that I can decide on whether I want to purchase them.
    <!-- Maybe add some customer reviews -->

### Structure

<!-- Talk about consistency across the pages in the website - common logo, menu etc. -->

## Planning and Collaboration

This project was delivered to meet a client specification for a new website and to align to the planned dates for submission of Milestone Project 1. Tools to facilitate planning, task assignment, tracking and collaboration were essential to ensure that the project was finished on schedule and to specification.

### Trello

Trello was used for task assignment, collaboration and tracking to ensure that all client and developer tasks were completed on time and to plan.

### JIRA

JIRA was utilised to capture user stories, tasks and bugs to be selected for development and to track development, testing and deployment activities to ensure the project was completed aligned to the product Roadmap.

### Frontify

Frontify was used to develop the Urban Paws branding template and enabled easy collaboration between the client and developer.

## Testing

### HTML and CSS Validation

### Lighthouse

To test quality and performance for desktop and mobile the Google Chrome dev tool Lighthouse was used. Reports were run and issues identified and fixed.

#### Initial Tests - following MS1 mid-point review and updates with advice from mentor - results and resolution

-   Desktop

    -   Home page - link to tests
    -   Shop Dog page - link to tests
    -   Shop Cat page - link to tests
    -   Contact Us page - link to tests

-   Mobile

    -   Home page - link to tests
    -   Shop Dog page - link to tests
    -   Shop Cat page - link to tests
    -   Contact Us page - link to tests

The results of these tests were analysed and the following changes were made to improve quality and performance

-   One
-   Two

#### Final Tests

The results of the final Lighthouse tests are detailed in the reports listed below.

### User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Focus testing on meeting the defined acceptance criteria documented alongside user stories -->

Acceptance criteria were written for each user story. The acceptance criteria were tested by the developer for each user story and User Acceptance Testing completed by the client. The results are listed below along with the issues raised which were logged in JIRA, resolved and retested.

####

Focus testing on meeting the defined acceptance criteria documented alongside user stories.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1.  Contact form:
    1.  Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2.  Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3.  Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4.  Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

-   Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
-   Different configuration files?
-   Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
