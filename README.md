# Urban Paws Website

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new start-up company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that are currently being developed and that will be for sale in the near future. The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate and that allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news.

## User Experience Design

### Strategy

The business goals for developing the website are:

- To attract users to the company website to promote the company and brand awareness and to drive online enquiries.
- To provide a simple, attractive, modern and responsive website.
- To present a consistent brand image to users.

### Scope

#### User Stories

#### Business

- As the branding director, I want the company branding template to be applied to the website so that the company presents a consistent brand image.
- As the business owner, I want the company website latency to be optimised so that users are less likely to abandon our website whilst using it.
- As the business owner, I want the company website to be search engine optimised, so that users can easily find our website.

#### First time visitors

- As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to be able to access the website on different devices so that i can use the device that is most convenient to me at the time.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website so that I can find out more about the company and it's offerings.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to follow the company on social media platforms so that I can stay informed about the company.


#### Returning visitors

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the company so that I can ask questions or receive announcements and updates about the company.
- As a returning visitor, I want to see new products that have been added so that I can decide on whether I want to purchase them.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Blog
- Shopping cart
- eCommerce capabilities

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

<!-- Remember to include JIRA, Trello etc. -->

## Testing

Focus testing on meeting the defined acceptance criteria documented alongside user stories.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
