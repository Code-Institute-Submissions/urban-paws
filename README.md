# Urban Paws Website

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new startup company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that are being developed and products that are for sale via links to listings on Aamzon.co.uk.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate and that allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news.

The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.

-   As the business owner, I want the company website latency to be optimised so that users are less likely to abandon our website whilst using it.
-   As the business owner, I want the company website to be search engine optimised, so that users can easily find our website.

#### First time visitors

-   As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to be able to access the website on different devices so that i can use the device that is most convenient to me at the time.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website so that I can find out more about the company and it's offerings.
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to follow the company on social media platforms so that I can stay informed about the company.

#### Returning visitors

-   As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the company so that I can ask questions or receive announcements and updates about the company.
