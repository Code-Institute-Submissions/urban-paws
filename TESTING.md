### Scope and Overview

The Urban Paws website is a basic static website that has been developed for a startup company. The website will enable users to find out more about the company, view products for sale and link to the Amazon for purchase of the products, link to the company social media accounts and contact the company via a contact form. The website is comprised of four pages - Home, Shop-Dog, Shop-Cat and About Us, with Modals incorporated for a contact form and product size guides.

The website has been developed using HTML5 and CSS3 and utilises the Bootstrap4 toolkit.

This document has been prepared to outline the testing strategy and will be approved by the owner of the Urban Paws business and website.

The testing is to be completed in two phases with the developer completing the first phase of testing prior to the business owner complete their own testing.

Defects identified during the testing process are captured in JIRA, fixed and then released to be re-tested.
